A UI5 Module to integrate a Excel Upload for Fiori Element Apps.  
This control simply enables the mass upload of data, independent of the backend, OData version and Fiori scenario.  
This is made possible by reading the Excel file and using the standard APIs.  
The control will submit not the file, but just the data from the Excel File.  
The integration of the control is designed to be as simple as possible and, in the best case, requires no configuration.

The aim is to support as many Fiori Scenarios and UI5 Versions as possibile.  
See here for all currently [supported Versions](https://marianfoo.github.io/ui5-cc-excelUpload/pages/SupportVersions/).
