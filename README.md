`ui5-cc-excelupload` is a UI5 Component designed for the integration of Excel Upload functionality into Fiori Elements and other UI5 Apps.  
It enables the bulk upload of data, independent of the backend, OData version, and Fiori scenario, by extracting data from an Excel file and leveraging standard APIs.  
Rather than submitting the file, the control only submits the extracted data.  
The control's integration aims for simplicity, requiring minimal to no configuration in the ideal scenario.

Our goal is to support as many Fiori Scenarios and UI5 Versions as possible. You can see the currently [supported versions here](https://marianfoo.github.io/ui5-cc-excelUpload/pages/SupportVersions/).
